  `**TL;DR:** In this post I look back on the journey of learning 5 different languages, from my native German, over English in school, to Indonesian, Spanish, and Chinese as an adult. I compare the structural differences from the perspective of a learner, my evolution of learning methods and resources, cultural insights and immersion, and how each language added something new to my personality.

### Why even create such a linguistic chaos in my head

Let me begin with a brief personal note—if you're not particularly interested in my backstory, feel free to [skip ahead to the next section](#structural-differences-from-german-to-chinese-from-europe-to-asia). The rest of the post will still make sense without diving into these details. For those who are curious about how I ended up filling my head with an array of languages, here’s the story.

I grew up speaking German, of course, but like most native speakers, I never thought much about the complexity of the language. I learned it naturally as a child, and it was simply the way I communicated. It wasn’t until much later that I realized just how intricate German grammar really is.

During my childhood, it felt sufficient to express my basic needs without giving much thought to other languages.
Spanish had an early presence in my life, as well. My grandmother lived in Spain, and my family often traveled there for vacations. Despite this, I never thought of Spanish as anything more than German with different sounds. I was curious about the language, but no one encouraged me to pursue it, so I never did.

It wasn’t until high school, when I started learning English, that I began to see languages differently. For the first time, I understood that languages have their own structures, their own unique ways of expressing things. You can say something in German that doesn’t quite translate into English, and vice versa. I also noticed that the structure of a language seemed to reflect the character of its speakers. Both German and Germans being a bit too dry and exact for their own good, for example.

However, like for many people, my experience with language learning in school wasn’t particularly inspiring. Language classes often felt more focused on passing exams than on actual communication, so I didn’t enjoy it much at the time. That said, I had plenty of exposure to English outside the classroom. I took other classes in English, and when I started playing guitar as a teenager, I was eager to understand the lyrics of the songs I played and watched tons of guitar tutorial videos in English. Most of the internet content I consumed was also in English—there simply wasn’t as much available in German back then (yes, feeling old writing this). Without much deliberate effort, I found myself absorbing English through these activities, almost passively assimilating it.

French, on the other hand, was a very different experience. I studied it for four years in high school, but with little natural exposure to the language and a series of poor teachers, it became a source of frustration. My classes were filled with rote memorization of vocabulary and verb conjugations, and I ended up disliking the language entirely. At the time, I convinced myself that I was simply not good at learning languages—reinforced by the stereotype that one is either good at STEM subjects (which I was) or languages, but not both.

For a long time after high school, I didn’t seriously engage with language learning. I still had a lingering desire to learn Spanish, and after visiting Taiwan, I also became interested in Chinese. However, my early attempts didn’t go very far. I took a few university classes but made little progress, and my motivation was low. I assumed I just wasn’t suited for learning languages.

Everything changed when I moved to Indonesia after finishing my master’s degree. I was there to volunteer and take online programming courses as I transitioned from materials science to software engineering. At first, I struggled to communicate because many of the people I met didn’t speak much English. If I wanted to make the most of my time there and have meaningful conversations, I needed to learn Indonesian.

To my surprise, Indonesian turned out to be much easier than I expected. The language is relatively simple, and the people I met were friendly and eager to chat. Within three months, I could hold basic conversations, and after six months, I felt comfortable discussing most day-to-day topics. More importantly, this was the first time I experienced language learning as a tool for real communication, not just as an academic exercise. It was a turning point for me. Before, I had never been particularly interested in languages for their own sake. But learning Indonesian allowed me to connect with people, make friends, and gain insight into a culture that I wouldn’t have accessed otherwise. **This realization made all the difference**.

After that experience, I decided to pick up Spanish again. This time, I approached it differently—self-study, getting a private tutor (who became a wonderful friend as well), and spending time in Spanish-speaking countries. I traveled to Spain and several Latin American countries, practicing the language as much as I could. It felt rewarding in a way that classroom learning never had, and I began to appreciate how much more immersive travel can be when you can speak the local language.

With Indonesian and Spanish under my belt, I thought I was ready for the next challenge: Chinese. I moved to Taiwan and began learning, but the experience was much more difficult than I anticipated. Chinese, with its characters and tonal system, presented obstacles I hadn’t faced with the other languages. It took a long time before I started making any real progress, and the early stages were filled with frustration. However, after six months, I can understand quite a bit and hold simple conversations. It’s still a work in progress, but I’m beginning to experience the same sense of achievement that motivated me in Indonesia.

So why do I continue to add to the linguistic chaos in my head? It’s not because I love languages themselves—I’m not particularly interested in studying grammar for the sake of it. But languages are tools of communication. They allow me to connect with people, understand new cultures, and see the world from different perspectives. And while the process can be difficult, it just feels so rewarding to work really hard for it, invest a lot of effort into it, and then see it paying off with things as simple as a little chat with an old lady at a bus stop.
That’s my story. Now, let’s dive into the more technical aspects of the languages I’ve learned and the methods I used.

### Structural Differences: From German to Chinese, from Europe to Asia

In this section, I want to explore how the languages I’ve learned—ranging from European languages like German, English, and Spanish to non-European ones like Indonesian and Chinese—differ in terms of grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation, and writing systems. What emerges are some clear contrasts: grammatical complexity versus simplicity, flexible versus fixed syntax, and how context plays an enormous role in certain languages. We'll also see how intuition can help when learning related languages but leads to confusion when tackling those from entirely different language families.

First, let’s begin with the European languages. They serve as a useful reference point for me personally, since this post is written in one, and they’re the linguistic environment I grew up in. European languages, like German, English, and Spanish, are notorious for their grammatical complexity (okay, English isn’t that bad). They come with a wide range of tenses, grammatical genders, plurals, cases, and modes, all of which must be carefully navigated using conjugations, declensions, and a myriad of pronouns. In German, for example, you have to keep track of four grammatical cases (nominative, accusative, dative, and genitive), each influencing not only articles but also adjective endings and pronoun forms. Spanish and German also use grammatical gender (masculine, feminine, and in German, neuter), meaning nouns and their corresponding articles and adjectives must agree in gender, which adds another layer of complexity.

For those of us who grew up speaking these languages, we rarely think about these rules explicitly. However, when you start learning a language like Indonesian or Chinese (when I speak of Chinese here, I mean Mandarin Chinese), it becomes painfully clear how overcomplicated European languages can be. In Indonesian, for instance, there are no tenses or conjugations—verbs don’t change forms, and grammatical gender doesn’t exist. Similarly, in Mandarin, verb forms remain constant regardless of tense, and particles like 了 or 過 simply indicate time. These differences highlight how European languages rely heavily on morphology, while other languages achieve clarity through simpler systems like context or word order.

Interestingly, this complexity isn't just confined to Germanic or Romance languages; it’s also found in other Indo-European languages, including those spoken in South Asia. Although I don’t speak any Indian languages, I’ve read some Sanskrit and Pali while studying Buddhist texts, and I've had conversations with Hindi and Nepali speakers about their languages. These languages, too, share many grammatical features with European languages, reinforcing the idea that such complexity runs deep within the Indo-European family.

But why do European languages need this grammatical complexity? One reason is that it allows for a great deal of flexibility in syntax. For example, in German, the different cases (nominative, accusative, dative, genitive) make it possible to reorder the elements of a sentence in ways that would be impossible in English, which relies on a fixed word order. This flexibility means that fewer things need to be referred to explicitly through context. The grammar handles a lot of the work. But this flexibility comes at a cost. The more flexible the syntax, the more intricate the grammar tends to be. And hence, the more frustration for learners (see Mark Twain’s [The Awful German Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Awful_German_Language)).

When I first started learning English, I had no idea how much easier it was for me compared to someone from a non-Germanic language background. English and German share common roots, which means that many words and grammatical structures are familiar. Vocabulary like "water" and _Wasser_, or "house" and _Haus_, make the transition smoother. Even Spanish, despite being a Romance language, didn’t feel entirely foreign. Besides being exposed to its sound a lot as a child, the concept of tenses was similar, and there’s also a large amount of shared Latin vocabulary across European languages, thanks to the long-standing influence of Latin in science, religion, and politics. The Norman conquest of England, which introduced a lot of French (and thus Latin) into English, further bridges the gap.

And then there’s the issue of pronunciation—English, with its irregular spellings and complex vowel system, often feels like a phonetic puzzle. Spanish, on the other hand, is a breeze in comparison, with a phonetically consistent and straightforward pronunciation system, and German, while having a bit more complex phonetic rules, is at least fairly consistent as well.

Now, let’s shift to Indonesian—a stark contrast to the grammatical maze of European languages. Indonesian is wonderfully simple in its grammar. There are no tenses, no cases, and no gendered nouns. You indicate past or future simply by adding time-related words like _sudah_ (already) for the past or _akan_ (will) for the future. The one notable grammatical feature is _imbuhan_, a system of affixation that modifies the meaning of root words. Even so, this system is intuitive and easy to grasp, and even allows you to sometimes infer words you haven’t learned yet.

This grammatical simplicity made learning Indonesian a pleasant experience, especially when compared to the headache-inducing German grammar that I now find is unnecessarily complicated. I’ve seen my Indonesian friends struggle to learn German, bewildered by all the rules and exceptions, and frankly, I understand their frustration. Even Spanish was already more than enough grammar for me to learn, and it pales in comparison to German grammar.

However, Indonesian has its own quirks. The language follows a more rigid subject-verb-object (SVO) word order. Some sentences require fixed structures to remain grammatically correct, particularly when using words like _yang_ (which/that). There’s also a vast array of synonyms due to the influence of multiple languages—Sanskrit, Arabic, Portuguese, Dutch, and, more recently, English. This means that word choice often depends heavily on the context, varying widely between casual conversation, formal speech, and written literature. Another advantage of Indonesian is that it uses the Latin script, which is very convenient for someone like me, coming from a European language background. The pronunciation is also quite straightforward, with few surprises or tongue-breaking sounds for a German speaker.

When I turned to Mandarin Chinese, I found a language that operates on entirely different principles. Mandarin has very little in the way of the grammatical complexity found in European languages—no tenses, no plurals, no cases, and no conjugations. Instead, it relies heavily on a strict word order to convey meaning. This is paired with a set of words and particles (like 了, 的, 還, 是, 也, 都, 會, 就, 才, 可, 起, 出, to name just a few) that modify the meaning of words in ways that are initially very confusing for someone who’s linguistic intuition is based on the structures of European languages. The same particles and the words they act on can have vastly different meanings depending on the context, adding a layer of complexity that takes a lot of time to get used to (still working on it…).

In Chinese, context is crucial, more so than in any other language I’ve encountered. Many Chinese words sound the same but have different meanings (homophones), and often the only way to differentiate them is through the surrounding words. This is especially true in spoken Chinese, where you can rarely say just one word and be understood. You almost always need to combine words into phrases or sentences to clarify meaning. The tonal system also plays a major role in distinguishing words that would otherwise be homophones. Unlike European languages, where pitch is used for emphasis or emotional tone, in Chinese, pitch is the meaning.

For me, the tonal system is by far the most challenging aspect of learning Chinese. My ear just doesn’t naturally pick up the changes in pitch. Even when I improvise on guitar, I focus more on finger movements than on pitch, and it turns out that this lack of pitch awareness carries over into my Chinese pronunciation. My tones are still shaky, and it’s hard for me to detect them when others speak. This is compounded by the fact that intonation and stress, which we use freely in European languages, serve an entirely different function in Mandarin. So in addition to getting used to how variation in pitch is used as an important part of every word in Mandarin, one also has to _stop_ using it for certain types of emphasis, the way it's used in European languages, or one might accidentally call someone's mother a horse.

Finally, there’s the Chinese writing system, which is completely different from the Latin alphabet. Mandarin uses characters, each representing a word or concept, rather than sounds. Unlike alphabetic scripts, these characters don’t directly convey how they’re pronounced. While many characters include components that hint at pronunciation or meaning, they don’t give you a complete picture, making it necessary to memorize thousands of characters and their pronunciation. Surprisingly, this hasn’t been the hardest part of learning Chinese for me—maybe because I’m quite good at memorizing things. Instead, my greatest difficulties lie in mastering the tones and listening comprehension. At the point of writing this, I’m in Taiwan for half a year already, and I still often have to ask people to repeat something 3 times before I really understand it.

### Learning Methods and Resources

#### Evolution of Learning Methods

The most important lesson I've learned throughout my language journey is that exposure is key. When you're young, the brain’s plasticity allows you to passively assimilate a language through immersion alone. That’s how I learned English—through classes, media, and casual conversation, all of which seemed to just “stick” without much conscious effort. However, as I got older and tried to learn Spanish and Chinese in university, it became obvious that this passive method wasn't enough. Without a system, I struggled. I didn't have the time or motivation back then to figure out how to learn systematically, but it became clear that a structured approach would be necessary.

My experience learning Indonesian while living in Indonesia marked a turning point in my approach to languages. Indonesian’s grammar is relatively simple, so I could quickly learn the basics (like imbuhan) from friends and practice in conversation. However, learning new vocabulary from scratch, without any overlap with German or English, posed a real challenge. I soon realized that memorizing large amounts of vocabulary required a different strategy, which I'll discuss later. With Spanish, I needed a more formal approach to master conjugations and grammar rules. When it came to Chinese, I overcomplicated things at first by creating very specific drills for tones, vocabulary, and grammar. But this method worked for me. As an adult, I found I needed this structure to systematically learn a piece of the language and then go out and apply it in conversation. The more languages I learned, and the more complex they became, the more structured my approach had to be.

One book that influenced my Chinese learning was [Fluent Forever](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IBZ405W/?tag=toweofbabe-20) by Gabriel Wyner, which introduced techniques like spaced repetition and focusing on pronunciation early. While I didn’t agree with everything, such as his "never translate" philosophy, I found many techniques helpful, especially as I became more systematic in my approach.

#### Resources and Budget

Another trend I've noticed is that you can absolutely learn a language for free—but with time as the primary currency. That’s how I approached Indonesian: I didn’t take any formal classes (because I had no budget for it), relying instead on self-study, conversation, and language exchanges. Only when being back in Germany and already having a decent job, I got a tutor for Indonesian. As my budget increased over the years, I began investing more in paid resources, which allowed me to learn faster and more efficiently. For both Spanish and Chinese, I found private tutors very helpful early on when it came to correcting grammar or pronunciation, and there were also a few useful and affordable apps.

Pronunciation has always been something I focus on from the very beginning, even if it feels strange at first. It’s so much easier to get the sounds right from the start than to unlearn bad habits later. This wasn’t a major issue for me with Indonesian or Spanish—Indonesian pronunciation came fairly naturally, and I had already heard a lot of Spanish as a child. In fact, my Spanish accent has evolved over time due to traveling, blending influences from Spain, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, Mexico, and more. But Chinese was a whole different beast. The tonal system is entirely foreign to European languages, so I spent weeks practicing pronunciation, including learning the Taiwanese phonetic script _Zhuyin_ (注音). Though my tones are still shaky, I often get told that my overall pronunciation is decent, compared to many other foreigners, so I guess the extra effort was worth it.

When it comes to memorizing vocabulary, I find rote memorization to be very inefficient. I rely on associations and _Eselsbrücken_ (mnemonics in German) to create personal connections with words. Whether I’m learning Indonesian, Spanish, or Chinese, I form vivid, often silly, stories around each word to make them stick in my memory. I engage as many senses and associations as possible. I also use spaced repetition systems (SRS) like Anki, which helps me review words at optimal intervals to prevent forgetting. To make it more effective, I add images, audio, and use new words in conversation as soon as possible. For Chinese characters, I used the [Hanzi Movie Method](https://www.mandarinblueprint.com/blog/chinese-mnemonics/) early on, creating stories for each character, which helped me manage the initial challenge of memorization. Over time, frequent exposure and practice have turned vocabulary learning into a more intuitive process for me.

In terms of resources, I’ve used a mix of books, apps, and classes over the years. Apps like Anki are excellent for vocabulary retention through spaced repetition, and specialized dictionaries like [SpanishDict](https://www.spanishdict.com/) and [Pleco](https://www.pleco.com/) are indispensable for deeper language study. However, I’m not a fan of apps like Duolingo that take you through a rigid, pre-defined path. They tend to focus on surface-level phrases rather than providing the fundamental principles needed to truly master a language.

Classes, especially larger ones, have a similar limitation—they tend to focus on exam preparation rather than providing the flexibility to explore a language freely. That said, I found that in the early stages of learning Chinese, classes were helpful. My Chinese was so bad that no one had the patience to talk to me, and a classroom setting provided a structured environment where I could build confidence and get a lot of exposure at a slower pace. The rigid structure was frustrating, but the Chinese-speaking environment was great at the time.

Ultimately, I believe self-study, private tutors, and language exchanges are the most flexible and effective methods. If you can afford a tutor, great; they can tailor the experience to your needs. If not, language exchanges offer a similar benefit at no cost (besides the time you invest in helping your partner learn your language). The most important resource, however, is motivation. I’ve heard many people say they can’t learn a language because they don’t have the money, but with the vast amount of free resources available online, that’s just an excuse. While in Indonesia, I learned the language without any paid classes, textbooks, or tutors—just through immersion and talking to people.

In the end, the effort you put in is what determines success. No one else can teach you a language—you have to learn it yourself. If you stay motivated, even with free resources, you can achieve fluency. For me, the driving force is the desire to connect with people from different cultures, to chat with everyone I meet. Whenever I get frustrated, I remind myself of that.

### Cultural Insight Through Language and Multiple Personalities

Each language I’ve learned has been a window into both the culture of the people who speak it and different sides of my own personality. The structure, tone, and rhythm of each language carry traces of the cultural values of the speakers, and this has shaped how I express myself when speaking each one. Interestingly, I find that as I switch languages, I also switch between different versions of myself.

#### English: A Global Tool and the "Neutral Me"

English, for me, isn’t tied to any specific culture. It’s a global language, a bridge that allows people from all over the world to communicate. I use it primarily in international contexts, rather than in any English-speaking country—whether in my work in science and technology or for accessing resources online. English has become my default language for thinking, writing, and even dreaming, despite German being my native language.

What’s fascinating about English is that, rather than connecting me to the culture of any one country, it connects me to the world. It doesn’t come with a fixed cultural identity; instead, it’s a flexible tool that adapts to different contexts and people. For that reason, my English-speaking personality feels balanced—like a "neutral me" that is open to both emotion and reason. In a way, English allows me to take the best from all worlds, without being tied to a specific cultural perspective. It’s the version of me that’s most adaptable.

#### German: Precision, Directness, and Rationality

German, on the other hand, feels deeply rooted in the culture it comes from. The precision of the language—with its cases, grammatical structures, and ability to form long compound words—mirrors the cultural values of thoroughness, order, and an obsession with rules that are often associated with Germany. German communication tends to be very direct, sometimes even blunt, and there’s often little room for ambiguity in how ideas are expressed. Conversations in German usually get straight to the point, reflecting a cultural tendency toward efficiency and practicality. For whatever reason, the German national railway company strictly distances itself from those values.

This German directness, which often comes across as harsh to non-German speakers, influences my own personality when I speak German. I notice that I become more assertive and less in touch with my emotions. Humor in German can also be darker and more sarcastic, and my judgments tend to be sharper. When I switch into German, I’m focused more on logic, reason, and facts, and less on how my words might be received emotionally. It’s not that I’m unfriendly in German (at least not on a German scale), but the language itself pulls me toward a more direct approach to communication.

#### Spanish: Passionate, Expressive, and Emotionally Open

Spanish is a completely different experience. The language itself, with its musicality, flow, and rich emotional vocabulary, reflects the warmth and passion of the cultures that speak it. Spanish is a language that encourages expressiveness, and this is deeply connected to the values of community, connection, and emotional openness that are common in both Spain and Latin America. The flexibility of verb conjugation and the use of diminutives often add emotional nuance to even the simplest statements, and conversations are often lively, punctuated by gestures and changes in tone.

When I speak Spanish, I find that I’m much more emotionally expressive. I say things in Spanish that would feel overly dramatic or cheesy in English or German, but in Spanish, they seem perfectly natural. My Spanish personality is more passionate, and I’m not afraid to be more flirty or playful. It feels like the language gives me permission to lean into emotion and connection in a way that other languages don’t. I can express myself more freely and even be a bit theatrical without feeling out of place, which makes Spanish conversations feel more intimate and engaging.

#### Indonesian: Simplicity, Inclusiveness, and Playfulness

Indonesian is, in many ways, a language that reflects the open and inclusive nature of the people who speak it. The language is remarkably simple, with no tenses, cases, or grammatical genders. This simplicity, rather than limiting communication, makes it accessible and pragmatic, which aligns with Indonesian culture’s emphasis on community and harmony. I always found it easy to make friends with Indonesians, and the language is really suitable for that. Indonesian doesn’t get bogged down by rules; it’s more about getting the message across in a way that everyone can understand, and sounding nice while doing so. Even the many borrowed words from other languages (like Arabic, Dutch, and Sanskrit) reflect a cultural openness to outside influences.

When I speak Indonesian, I find that I take on a lighter, more playful personality. Conversations in Indonesian tend to be more relaxed and humorous, with less emphasis on precision and more focus on maintaining a friendly, easy-going vibe. My Indonesian personality feels more pragmatic, not worrying too much about perfect grammar, and more focused on just getting things done. It’s a version of me that doesn’t take life too seriously, and it fits perfectly with the language’s straightforward structure and the laid-back attitude of the people.

#### Chinese: Context, Nuance, and a Developing Personality

Mandarin Chinese is unique in how deeply it relies on context and nuance, which mirrors the cultural focus on relationships and social harmony in Chinese-speaking societies. The language itself uses a tonal system, meaning that slight changes in pitch can alter the meaning of a word entirely. This requires a high level of attentiveness and sensitivity to subtle differences, much like how Chinese culture often values maintaining balance and understanding in social interactions.

In Chinese, context is everything. The same word can mean completely different things depending on the surrounding words, and this reflects the importance of understanding the whole situation, not just individual elements. This emphasis on context makes Mandarin feel less direct than German or English—it’s about reading between the lines and paying attention to what’s unsaid as much as what’s said.
I haven’t yet fully developed a "Chinese personality," as I’m still working on becoming fluent. As I continue to improve, I’m curious about what my Chinese personality will evolve into.

Speaking multiple languages hasn’t just helped me connect with different cultures—it’s also allowed me to explore different versions of myself. Each language brings out distinct characteristics in both how I think and how I interact with others. Whether it’s the balanced, global "me" when I speak English, the rational and assertive side that comes out in German, the passionate and emotionally expressive version of myself in Spanish, or the playful and pragmatic personality that shines through in Indonesian, each language unlocks something unique.
And as I continue to grow in Chinese, I look forward to discovering what side of me it will reveal. It’s fascinating to think that learning a language isn’t just about words and grammar—it’s about discovering new ways to see the world and new ways to be yourself.

### Travel and Immersion: How Speaking the Language Makes a Difference

Let’s be honest: traveling with German doesn’t get you very far unless you’re in Germany, Austria or Switzerland (and even then, Swiss German is a whole other language—I can barely understand it myself). That said, I’m often surprised by how many people I meet abroad who are studying German or at least have an interest in it. Many dream of working in Germany one day, and it’s always fascinating to hear why they’ve chosen to tackle such a grammatically horrifying language.

English, of course, is much more practical for traveling. It’s spoken all over the world, especially in airports, tour agencies, and other tourist-centric places. I’ve found it’s usually enough to get by. Still, I was surprised in Latin America by how many tour guides or hostel owners didn’t actually speak English at all, even in popular tourist spots. While English is a great tool for navigating the basics, it’s usually not enough if you want to go beyond the typical tourist experience and truly connect with people and places.

That’s where learning the local language is the only thing that really helps. When you know the local language, you can talk to pretty much anyone—not just the few who’ve learned English. This opens the door to a whole new level of experience. You can ask people about their lives, their culture, their history, and they can tell it to you in their native language. There’s something special about hearing stories directly in the language they were meant to be told in, without the filter of translation. To be fair, I also had wonderful experiences with local people in places that I didn’t speak the language of. Usually English-speaking people I met on [Couchsurfing](https://www.couchsurfing.com/), but the number of those is, of course, much smaller.

Speaking the local language also helps you escape the typical tourist traps. You can ask locals for their personal recommendations, and those are almost always better than anything a guidebook or travel blog will suggest. On top of that, it often gets you better prices. I’ve haggled my way to almost local rates at markets in Indonesia—sometimes even getting into tourist attractions at the local price instead of the overpriced foreigner rate by explaining that I was living and working there as a volunteer teacher. Although, once I had to sing the national anthem to prove it…_Indonesia raya, merdeka, merdeka_…

Language is also a key to participating in cultural events that would otherwise be a bit meaningless if you couldn’t understand what was happening. Whether it’s art shows, concerts, theater performances, or even joining a friend’s family for dinner, speaking the language brings these experiences to life. I’ve watched _Lucha Libre_ matches in Mexico, attended culture carnivals, karate classes, and concerts in Indonesia, theater plays in Bolivia, and taken part in local festivals pretty much everywhere—things that would’ve felt a bit out of reach, or maybe even boring, without knowing what was going on around me.

In some cases, speaking the local language isn’t just a nice bonus, but a matter of security. There have been a couple of situations where I needed help but didn’t dare ask because I wasn’t confident I could explain what was wrong. It’s a scary feeling to think that if something went really wrong, you wouldn’t be able to verbally defend yourself, especially in places where there’s a general suspicion toward foreigners. In contrast, there have been moments when I did speak the local language, and it made all the difference. People were willing to step in and help me, simply because I could explain the situation.

Even when you only know the basics of a language, it can still make a huge difference. Just being able to say a few key words—asking for food, directions, or help—can get you through most situations. And modern translation apps are a blessing, too. I’ve used them a lot to supplement my limited vocabulary, but nothing replaces the feeling of being able to communicate directly.

Sometimes, knowing just a little of the local language helps ease the tension in situations where people are afraid to speak English. In Taiwan, for example, I often ask if people can speak English when dealing with things like opening a bank account or getting my driving license, and the answer is usually, “No, not at all!” But I know that’s not entirely true—English is taught in schools there, so most people have at least a basic grasp of it. The issue is more about the fear of making mistakes and feeling embarrassed. But if I start trying to speak in my far-from-perfect Chinese (most likely making a fool of myself in the process), suddenly people feel more comfortable meeting me halfway. They’ll supplement the bits of Chinese I know with the bits of English they know, and somehow, we make it work. It’s a small but powerful way of showing respect, and it breaks the ice.

Ultimately, just trying your best in the local language is often enough to win people’s sympathy and kindness. In most places, even when I completely butcher the pronunciation or grammar, locals appreciate the effort and treat me much more warmly than if I’d just relied on Google Translate or, even worse, expected them to speak English. It’s not about being perfect; it’s about showing that you care enough to try.

### Conclusion

Learning and speaking multiple languages has profoundly shaped my understanding of the world and the different cultures I’ve encountered. Each language brought me closer to the people who speak it, allowing me to experience places from the inside rather than as an outsider. From the structured precision of German to the emotional expressiveness of Spanish, the pragmatic simplicity of Indonesian, and the contextual complexity of Mandarin, each language opened a unique door to new experiences and a different version of myself.

That said, I think Chinese will be my last language—at least for a long while. There’s already so much linguistic chaos in my head that it's getting a bit crowded in there. Just learning Chinese and maintaining the other languages I know is already quite time-consuming. And as much as I’ve enjoyed diving into the world of languages, my real passion lies elsewhere. My focus will always be on being a programmer and software engineer, a field that requires constant learning and the development of new skills. It’s what I find most interesting, and it’s the path I’ll continue to prioritize as I move forward. While languages have been a rewarding part of my journey, programming is where I’ll keep pushing myself to grow. But it will always feel great to put the languages I’ve learned to use to connect to people everywhere.
